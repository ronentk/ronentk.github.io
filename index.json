Deep learning algorithms drawing upon massive amounts of data and specialized hardware have achieved impressive empirical progress, powering applications from multilingual machine translation to wise-cracking chatbots. However, state-of-the-art NLP algorithms continue to struggle with tasks that schoolchildren find trivial. For example, consider the following story: “John dropped the wine glass on the coffee table and watched with dismay as it shattered into pieces.”\nMost people would easily identify “it” as referring to the wine glass. However, current NLP algorithms find this deduction difficult; most algorithms we tested judged it likely that both the wine glass and the coffee table shattered into pieces. The situation becomes even more complex with sentences whose meaning is not literal, such as “John’s career hopes shattered.”\nPerhaps the problem is the way that these algorithms learn about the world. Typically, NLP algorithms read terabytes of texts, extracting statistical patterns of language use from them. However, research in the Cognitive Sciences, and specifically Embodied Cognitive Linguistics (ECL), argues that when people communicate, a lot of the meaning is not even present in the words. Instead, ECL claims that people use embodied world knowledge to understand language, both literal (wine glasses) and non-literal (career hopes). Embodied means such knowledge is deeply dependent on features of human physical bodies, such as the abilities of locomotion, perception, and emotion.\n Language (Re)modelling: Towards Embodied Language Understanding aims to integrate ideas from ECL into current NLP research. The work highlights two crucial cognitive capabilities missing in today’s NLP methods: mental simulation and metaphoric interpretation.\nAccording to ECL’s Simulation Hypothesis, language users come to the text armed with vast world knowledge and a powerful imagination that facilitates conjuring detailed simulations of the world to achieve language understanding, such as knowing what happens when a wine glass drops. To simulate a more abstract concept like “career hopes”, ECL’s Conceptual Metaphor Theory hypothesizes that, through metaphor, humans creatively construe more abstract concepts in terms of more concrete concepts. In other words, language users imagine concepts that are hard to simulate (career hopes) in terms of those that are easier to simulate. Construing career hopes as a physical object makes sense, since their “breaking” evokes the notion that they may be hard to recover.\nImportantly, both mental simulation and metaphoric interpretation derive from interaction in the world rather than via static text. Accordingly, the paper argues for designing cognitively-inspired architectures, including diverse simulation environments through which the next generation of AI agents can begin learning the world knowledge necessary for more human-like language understanding. Ultimately, the deeply embodied nature of language implies that we needn’t worry about AI poets surpassing humans in writing skill anytime soon. Rather, it suggests that a tighter integration between contemporary cognitive science and NLP research is a promising approach towards AI assistants with a better understanding of human language.\n","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"f8329d62c7d833ba2148c0eebdbc9dc3","permalink":"https://ronentk.github.io/post/acl2020-blog/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/acl2020-blog/","section":"post","summary":"Blog version of our upcoming ACL2020 Theme Track paper","tags":null,"title":"Language (Re)modelling: Towards Embodied Language Understanding (blog version)","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

According to ECL, natural language is inherently executable (like programming languages), driven by mental simulation and metaphoric mappings over hierarchical compositions of structures and schemata learned through embodied interaction.

However, extensive empirical research has shown this to be a double-edged sword, coming at the cost of shallow understanding: inferior generalization, grounding and explainability. Grounded language learning approaches offer the promise of deeper understanding by situating learning in richer, more structured training environments, but are limited in scale to relatively narrow, predefined domains. How might we enjoy the best of both worlds: grounded, general NLU? Following extensive contemporary cognitive science, we propose treating environments as ``first-class citizens'' in semantic representations, worthy of research and development in their own right. Importantly, models should also be partners in the creation and configuration of environments, rather than just actors within them, as in existing approaches. To do so, we argue that models must begin to understand and program in the language of affordances (which define possible actions in a given situation) both for online, situated discourse comprehension, as well as large-scale, offline common-sense knowledge mining. To this end we propose an environment-oriented ecological semantics, outlining theoretical and practical approaches towards implementation. We further provide actual demonstrations building upon interactive fiction programming languages.","tags":null,"title":"Ecological Semantics: Programming Environments for Situated Language Understanding","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" External link\n","date":1583798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583798400,"objectID":"94e7828830cb24774b914370b8c1da7b","permalink":"https://ronentk.github.io/post/bac/","publishdate":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bac/","section":"post","summary":"External link","tags":null,"title":"Popular science piece on embodied cognition and AI (Hebrew).","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Helix advances in rounds, where in each round, the primary node (elected among the network nodes) proposes a potential block (a successive set of transactions). In order to be included in the blockchain, a block must pass validation by an elected committee of nodes. Helix nodes are presumed to have two primary preferences. They prefer to be elected as committee members. Additionally, because each transaction is associated with one of the network nodes, they prefer to prioritize their own transactions over those of others. In light of these individual preferences, our definition of fairness incorporates three key elements. First, the process of electing nodes to committees is random and unpredictable. Second, a correlated sampling scheme is used in order to guarantee random selection and ordering of pending transactions in blocks. Third, transactions are encrypted in order to hide their associations with their respective nodes and prevent censorship. Through the corresponding threshold decryption process we obtain an unpredictable and non-manipulable randomness beacon, which serves both the election process and the correlated sampling scheme. We define a quantitative measure of fairness in the protocol, prove theoretically that fairness manipulation in Helix is significantly limited, and present experiments evaluating fairness in practice.","tags":null,"title":"A Fair Consensus Protocol for Transaction Ordering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nadav Cohen","Ronen Tamari","Amnon Shashua"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"1fa13f112cd5da7341084c281aab3187","permalink":"https://ronentk.github.io/publication/cohen-2018-boosting/","publishdate":"2020-03-15T09:01:55.259002Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cohen-2018-boosting/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Boosting Dilated Convolutional Networks with Mixed Tensor Decompositions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Or Sharir","Ronen Tamari","Nadav Cohen","Amnon Shashua"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ecb424885ef30aed3b787b82518bd041","permalink":"https://ronentk.github.io/publication/sharir-2016-a/","publishdate":"2020-03-15T09:01:55.259492Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharir-2016-a/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a generative model, we call Tensorial Mixture Models (TMMs) based on mixtures of basic component distributions over local structures (e.g. patches in an image) where the dependencies between the local-structures are represented by a \"priors tensor\" holding the prior probabilities of assigning a component distribution to each local-structure. In their general form, TMMs are intractable as the prior tensor is typically of exponential size. However, when the priors tensor is decomposed it gives rise to an arithmetic circuit which in turn transforms the TMM into a Convolutional Arithmetic Circuit (ConvAC). A ConvAC corresponds to a shallow (single hidden layer) network when the priors tensor is decomposed by a CP (sum of rank-1) approach and corresponds to a deep network when the decomposition follows the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) model. The ConvAC representation of a TMM possesses several attractive properties. First, the inference is tractable and is implemented by a forward pass through a deep network. Second, the architectural design of the model follows the deep networks community design, i.e., the structure of TMMs is determined by just two easily understood factors: size of pooling windows and number of channels. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model when tackling the problem of classification with missing data, leveraging TMMs unique ability of tractable marginalization which leads to optimal classifiers regardless of the missingness distribution.","tags":null,"title":"Tensorial Mixture Models","type":"publication"}]
