 title={“What’s My Model Inside of?” : Exploring the Role of Environments for Grounded Natural Language Understanding}, 
 abstractNote={In recent years, deep learning based approaches to natural language processing (NLP) have made impressive progress. A particularly important achievement has been the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), massive artificial neural networks trained on internet scale linguistic data. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide variety of tasks, including long standing challenges like few-shot learning and coherent long-form text generation. LLMs seem to be doing more than just “processing” natural language (NLP), perhaps they are also understanding natural language (NLU)? Indeed, a core ongoing debate being fueled by these advances is the Symbol Grounding Problem; computational models of language process only linguistic input (symbols), so how can their outputs be grounded to the external world to which the language refers to? Or in other words, since meaning also includes extra-linguistic referents (actions, percepts, semantic knowledge), can LLMs reliably understand language, i.e.,extract the meaning conveyed by linguistic symbols? The debate is far from settled, and has significant implications for guiding the future of NLP research as well as real-world applications; some are claiming LLM research is climbing the wrong hill altogether, some advocate for more cognitively inspired architectures, while others believe that LLMs are early demonstrations of so-called “Artificial General Intelligence”. This PhD thesis proposes a novel environment-oriented perspective on the language grounding debate and towards NLU research more broadly. Our approach is inspired by ecological accounts of cognition, which provide a more holistic account of the role of the body and environment in shaping cognition, in contrast to classical cognitive science which focused on studying brains in isolation. Similarly, we adopt an ecological approach to NLU research. Where current NLU research tends to focus on models in isolation, we developed a more holistic perspective accounting for the deep yet under-explored coupling between models and the environments with which they interact. Wittgenstein famously wrote that “The limits of my language mean the limits of my world”. The thesis can be stated simply, in an inversion of that dictum, that “The limits of my environments mean the limits of my language (models)”. Environments are the computational spaces in which models are embedded, which support data annotation as well as model training, development and evaluation. The ecological perspective provides novel insights on each of those critical components of the NLU research pipeline, and also contributes to the broader debate around how to pursue more reliable and grounded natural language understanding systems.
