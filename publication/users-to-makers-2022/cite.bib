	abstract = {The web has become a dominant epistemic environment, influencing people’s beliefs at a global scale. However, online epistemic environments are increasingly polluted, impairing societies’ ability to coordinate effectively in the face of global crises. We argue that centralized platforms are a main source of epistemic pollution, and that healthier environments require redesigning how we collectively govern attention. Inspired by decentralization and open source software movements, we propose Open Source Attention, a socio-technical framework for “freeing” human attention from control by platforms, through a decentralized eco-system for creating, storing and querying stigmergic markers; the digital traces of human attention.},
