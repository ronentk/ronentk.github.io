I'm a PhD student in the [Hyadata Science Lab](http://www.hyadatalab.com/) in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, under the supervision of Dafna Shahaf.

I'm interested in the integration of data-driven and symbolic reasoning approaches towards novel natural language understanding and information retrieval algorithms, primarily through graph-based representation and learning methods.

Human cognition has always been fascinating to me, and I'm intrigued by the prospect of natural intelligence inspired AI, and vice versa. Currently, I'm researching methods for incorporating "mental simulation" capabilities into natural language understanding algorithms.

My B.Sc and M.Sc were also at Hebrew University, in computer engineering and computer science, respectively. My M.Sc thesis was on applications of hierarchical tensor decompostions towards principled neural network design, under the supervision of Amnon Shashua.
